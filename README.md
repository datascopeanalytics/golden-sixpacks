# Golden Sixpacks

Golden Sixpacks are yearly awards that Datascope is experimenting with
as a mechanism to recognize each others' accomplishments.

### Main guidelines

- Like the Oscars, we have multiple categories, with one award in each
- The categories represent the different avenues of value we bring
- People nominate others for awards, with a short (tweet-length)
  description of what they deserve the nomination
- For each award, we all vote anonymously (you can't vote for yourself)
- Winner of each award is announced
- We divide the performance bonus pool by the number of awards, each award comes with one such unit of bonus

### Awards
- **The Closer**  Bringer of new clients and projects
- **The Executer**  Getter-doner of shit (code / management / correspondence)
- **The Rockstar**  Contributor to Datascopeâ€™s reputation (blog posts / talks /

- **The Professor**  Trainer of self and colleagues (analysis / code / design
